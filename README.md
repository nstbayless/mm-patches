# Micro Mages Bounce Hack

Tired of bouncing when landing? If you are, and you want a very specific cure for this problem, this is the hack for you!

## Build instructions

Please place the ROM in the file `base.nes`.

Patching uses the assembler [wla-dx](http://www.villehelin.com/wla.html), so that must be on the system PATH.

Run `build.bat` and out.nes as well as a patch should be produced.
